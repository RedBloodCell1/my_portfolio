Hello, So today I'm gonna try to make my own portfolio. But of course i am not that good at react yet. So i will need to follow some tutorial. I know that i have learned react before. But you know what they say, if you don't create anything, U will never really understand and remember anything aside from you ever learning it before.

Here is the link of the tutorial i use:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQCDUJ6hhNY (To make the portfolio)

Day 1: 24 minutes of study (I finish setting up things)

Okay here we go again, react. I will not say much cause i have learned react before. But still if there is something i wanna write, then of course i will write it. Cause whos gonna stop me? XDD

Welcome back to day 1. Of course i manage to find a way to not study again. Well i got a good reason for it. My thesis is almost done and i have done my final exam. So today i am actually gonna start.

I promise im gonna finish at least 1 hour of the video today.

I dont like this depressed feelings. I feel like its better for me to stop right now and continue tomorrow. Okay i will finish it within 24 hours. Tomorrow will be the day i focus totally on this. I dont want to delete my promise because this will remind me of how shit i am as a person right now. But i will surely change. One day i will be reading this and i can finally say that i have come a long way. See you tomorrow

What i learned:

- npm run dev = to start the server
- Just setting up simple things like and deleting stuff. and learning a little bit about figma developer mode. See you later
