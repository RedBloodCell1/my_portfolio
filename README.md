Hello, So today I'm gonna try to make my own portfolio. But of course i am not that good at react yet. So i will need to follow some tutorial. I know that i have learned react before. But you know what they say, if you don't create anything, U will never really understand and remember anything aside from you ever learning it before.

Here is the link of the tutorial i use:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQCDUJ6hhNY (To make the portfolio)

Day 1: 24 minutes of study (I finish setting up things)

Okay here we go again, react. I will not say much cause i have learned react before. But still if there is something i wanna write, then of course i will write it. Cause whos gonna stop me? XDD

Welcome back to day 1. Of course i manage to find a way to not study again. Well i got a good reason for it. My thesis is almost done and i have done my final exam. So today i am actually gonna start.

I promise im gonna finish at least 1 hour of the video today.

I dont like this depressed feelings. I feel like its better for me to stop right now and continue tomorrow. Okay i will finish it within 24 hours. Tomorrow will be the day i focus totally on this. I dont want to delete my promise because this will remind me of how shit i am as a person right now. But i will surely change. One day i will be reading this and i can finally say that i have come a long way. See you tomorrow

What i learned:

- npm run dev = to start the server
- Just setting up simple things like and deleting stuff. and learning a little bit about figma developer mode. See you later

Day 2: (1 Hour + ) of study

What i learned:

- Vite uses jsx
- href with "/" inside will take is to top the page
- We can put variable for css and use it. Use :root {} and put the variable inside with **--text-color: red** and then we can import it from another css file to use it. This way we can change how the colour should be just from one css variable page without breaking anything
- After doing standard sizing. We want to make the page responsive
- Use **@media screen and (max-width: 800px) {}** To simply make a web responsive. So when the page is below 800px, the styling written inside the media screen will be applied
- I have learned about react before so i understand the use of ? and &&. And i understand a little bit of useState. I cant imagine learning this vid without learning react tutorial beforehand, either way. There is a lot of interesting way to take advantage of useState. For example in this, we can put 2 className using `` and with &&, we can see whether the styles useState variable is false or true. Idk how to explain this so it just looks like i am spouting gibberish but i understand probably around 75% and 100% if i slowly digest it.

CSS:

Lets actually study css. i will write what i know about something with my own sentence. Okay nevermind, im gonna learn about css in css video one day.
