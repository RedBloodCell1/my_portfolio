Hello, So today I'm gonna try to make my own portfolio. But of course i am not that good at react yet. So i will need to follow some tutorial. I know that i have learned react before. But you know what they say, if you don't create anything, U will never really understand and remember anything aside from you ever learning it before.

Here is the link of the tutorial i use:

Day 1:

Okay here we go again, react. I will not say much cause i have learned react before. But still if there is something i wanna write, then of course i will write it. Cause whos gonna stop me? XDD

Welcome back to day 1. Of course i manage to find a way to not study again. Well i got a good reason for it. My thesis is almost done and i have done my final exam. So today i am actually gonna start.

I promise im gonna finish at least 1 hour of the video today.

What i learned:
